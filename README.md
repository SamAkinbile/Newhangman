## What is Hangman game?
Hangman is a word-guessing game that is often played between two people. One person thinks of a word and draws a blank line for each letter in the word. The other person tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure (representing a "hangman") is drawn. The goal is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.

### Setup

- Determine the maximum number of guesses (life) allowed. You have a chance of 6 lifes


### Displaying the Word
